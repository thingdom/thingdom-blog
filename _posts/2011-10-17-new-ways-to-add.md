title: New Ways to Add
---

Many of you have told us that sharing your things on **[The
Thingdom][thingdom]** is fun, even addictive, but that the process is too slow
and manual.

We've heard you loud and clear, and we're excited to announce some exciting
new features and improvements that make adding things a whole lot easier ---
and even more fun.

The first is **[bulk add][bulk]**. Instead of adding one thing at a time, you
can now add all your things in one go. This works especially well for media:
books, movies, music and video games.

(We recommend curling up in front of your bookshelves with a laptop or an
[iPad][ipad] and trying this out; it's amazing to rediscover your library!)

You can also now import your **[Amazon purchase history][amazon]**. With just
a few clicks, you can see everything you've ever bought on Amazon! We highly
recommend trying this out, too; it's equally amazing.

(It's also safe, secure and fully private. We never ask for your password, and
you choose what things you want to share.)

Finally, if you're a Delicious Library user and have already catalogued your
things in the past, you can now import your **[Delicious Library][delicious]**
as well. We support both v1 and v2.

([Delicious Library][delicious-app] is a popular Mac app for cataloging your
stuff. Its killer feature is the ability to scan barcodes via your webcam.
It's a fantastic app; we aim to make it social.)

In addition to these new features, we've also made having and wanting just
*feel* faster. It no longer causes a page change, and you can immediately move
onto the next thing.

So we hope you enjoy these **[new ways to add][add]**, and as always, we
welcome your feedback! You can use our [user forum][uservoice], or you can
just [email us][email]. We look forward to hearing from you.
