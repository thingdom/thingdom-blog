FiftyThree is a team of world-class [designers and
developers][fiftythree-about] building tools for mobile creation. Using
the technology that powers The Thingdom, we'll be connecting people around
their ideas and creations just as we connected them around their haves and wants.

**The site and all content will remain up for the immediate future**, but
development has stopped, and new sign-ups are closed. We plan to shut down the
site eventually, but we'll do our best to notify you and let you download your
data before we do.

To that end, **make sure you have an up-to-date email address** under your
[notification settings][settings] — this is how we'll reach you. And as
always, if you have any questions, comments or suggestions, send us an
[email][] or visit our [forum][].

Onward to the next one — **[join us][fiftythree]**.
