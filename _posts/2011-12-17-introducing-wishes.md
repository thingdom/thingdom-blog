title: Introducing Wishes
---

With the holidays coming up, we heard from some of you that you wanted a way
to highlight and share just the things you *really* want.
Today, we're releasing "wishes", which lets you do just that.

To "wish" for something, login to **[The Thingdom][thingdom]** and click the
**Profile** link at the top. Then move your mouse over something you want,
and click the star that appears above it:

And voil√†, your want is now a wish:

To view and share your wishes, click the **Wishlist** link below your
profile picture:

You can now share this page with your family and friends, and it'll always
remain up-to-date as you add and remove more wishes.

So get wishing! Your family and friends won't be able to say they didn't know
what you wanted this season.

As always, we welcome your feedback: [email][email] / [forum][forum].
