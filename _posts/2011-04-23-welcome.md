To our family and friends,

We're excited to finally share with you the *thing* we've been working on:
[Thingdom](http://www.thethingdom.com/).

In a nutshell, Thingdom gives you and your friends a place to post the things
you **have** and **want**. Think "Amazon meets Facebook".

Here are some links to show you what we mean:

* [Aseem's profile](http://www.thethingdom.com/aseemk)
* [Daniel's profile](http://www.thethingdom.com/gasi)
* [Apple's iPad 2](http://www.thethingdom.com/5)

Don't you *want* that beautiful iPad 2? Or do you already *have* it? ;)

To share your own things, we've made a couple of handy bookmarklets.
Drag them from the home page up to your bookmarks bar and click them
whenever you see something on the web that you have or want.

The bookmarklets currently work best on [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/), but
let us know if you're aching to use another site.

We have lots of ideas for where to go with this --- and we're actively working
on some of them --- but we're more interested in hearing where *you* want us to
go.

So give it a whirl, and let us know what you think! You can log your ideas and
vote on others' through our [user forum](http://thingdom.uservoice.com/), or
you can just [email us](mailto:feedback@thethingdom.com).

We hope you enjoy our creation, and we eagerly await your feedback.

From your Thingdom team,

Aseem & Daniel
