To our family and friends,

We're excited to finally share with you the *thing* we've been working on:
[Thingdom](http://www.thethingdom.com/).

In a nutshell, Thingdom gives you and your friends a place to post the things
you **have** and **want**. Think "Amazon meets Facebook".

Here are some links to show you what we mean:

* [Aseem's profile](http://www.thethingdom.com/aseemk)
* [Daniel's profile](http://www.thethingdom.com/gasi)
* [Apple's iPad 2](http://www.thethingdom.com/things/5)

Don't you *want* that beautiful iPad 2? Or do you already *have* it? ;)

To post your own things, we've made a couple of handy bookmarklets, available
on the home page. Just drag them up to your bookmarks bar and click them
whenever you see something on the web that you have or want.

We have lots of ideas for where to go with this --- and we're actively working
on some of them --- but we're most interested to hear where *you* want us to go.

So give it a whirl, and let us know what you think! You can log your ideas and
vote on others' through our [user forum](http://thingdom.uservoice.com/), or
you can just [email us](mailto:feedback@thethingdom.com).

We hope you enjoy our creation, and we eagerly await your feedback.


From your Thingdom team,

Aseem, Daniel, Sanjay, Sergio
