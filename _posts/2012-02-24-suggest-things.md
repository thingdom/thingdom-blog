title: Suggest Things

We think it's pretty cool, fun and useful that **[The Thingdom][thingdom]**
lets you see your friends' books, movies and games all in one spot. But what
if your friends haven't added their things yet?

Previously, you could give them a nudge by writing on their wall. But now, you
can go one step further --- and even help them out --- by suggesting things
for them to add!

Just look for the **"Suggest for someone"** link wherever you see "Have" and
"Want" buttons (e.g. [search results][search-results] and
[thing pages][thing-page]). You'll need to be logged in if you aren't already.

[search-results]: http://www.thethingdom.com/search?q=settlers+of+catan
[thing-page]: http://www.thethingdom.com/58-The-Settlers-of-Catan

You can then choose who you want to suggest that thing to, and that person
will get notified via email of your suggestion.

We've also found this to be a great way to recommend specific things to
specific people. If you have friends who haven't read
[Ender's Game][enders-game], seen [Office Space][office-space] or played
[Settlers of Catan][settlers-of-catan], suggest it to them!

[enders-game]: http://www.thethingdom.com/458-Enders-Game-Ender-Book-1
[office-space]: http://www.thethingdom.com/112-Office-Space-Special-Edition-with-Flair-Widescreen-Edition
[settlers-of-catan]: http://www.thethingdom.com/58-The-Settlers-of-Catan

We hope suggestions make **[The Thingdom][thingdom]** more fun and useful for
you. As always, we'd love your feedback: [email][email] / [forum][forum].
