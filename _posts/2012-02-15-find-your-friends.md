title: Find Your Friends

When we first built **[The Thingdom][thingdom]**, we made it its own site
rather than an "app" entirely within Facebook or Twitter.

[thingdom]: http://www.thethingdom.com/

We did this because we think it's useful to have separate "social graphs"
for separate contexts. As Fred Wilson [notes][avc]:

At the same time, there almost always exists overlap between these sites, and
The Thingdom is no exception.

So today, we're excited to share a new feature we've built that aims to help
with this overlap:

With one click, you can now find your friends from Facebook or Twitter on The
Thingdom, and you can follow whichever of them you like.

To try it out, just visit our revamped **["People"][people]** page. You'll
need to be logged in if you aren't already.

We hope you find this feature convenient and helpful! As always, we welcome
your feedback: [email][email] / [forum][forum].
