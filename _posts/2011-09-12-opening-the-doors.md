title: Opening the Doors
---

We're very excited to share that after several months of hard work, we're
finally opening the doors to **[The Thingdom][thingdom]**!

We welcome and encourage you to share the site with your friends now and
invite them to join. We've added Facebook, Twitter and Google+ buttons across
the site to make this easy.

We couldn't have made it this far without the invaluable feedback of our beta
users, so thank you. (We want to call out [Boris Bluntschli][424f], [Gerd
Zellweger][gz] and [Frida Kumar][frida] for being particularly prolific.)

Over the last few months, we've iterated on your feedback and brought The
Thingdom to a whole new level. Among the highlights:

- **Categories.** We smartly categorize most things automatically, and you can
  now categorize the ones we miss.

- **Twitter integration.** You can tweet links and photos of things you #have
  or #want, and we'll pick them up.

- **A beautiful redesign** that conveys more information per page while
  keeping the site clean and minimal.

- **Item search**, backed by Amazon's vast database, that lets you add new
  things without needing to leave the site.

- **Discussions and notifications.** Add a comment or ask a question, and get
  notified when others do the same.

- **Followers and feeds.** Follow people you're interested in, and keep up
  with their haves, wants and even comments.

So check out **[The Thingdom][thingdom]** in its latest state if you haven't
already, and as always, let us know what you think! (You can do so via our
[user forum](http://thingdom.uservoice.com/) or via
[email](mailto:feedback@thethingdom.com).)

We're very excited to enter this new stage, and we look forward to your continued feedback.
